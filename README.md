The Gaming Room software design document

#### Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client was a company named The Gaming Room and they wanted to design a web-based game on multiple platforms named Draw It or Lose It.

#### What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
In developing the document, I would say I did well in the recommendations bit where I researched on most pro's and cons of various system architectures

#### What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Creating the document I realized it was really helpful to research and know what architecture would work best in developing the applications rather than building blindly. 

#### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would definitely re-do the system evaluation, I would start by doing more research on different system requirements. Researching on this part of the template was a bit confusing to me but was clear once the entire project was done. I would improve it by giving a more detailed report.

#### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The user needs are the most important since the game is built for user's, any UI/UX developer should know how to get their application to be easy and seamless for user's to user since most people don't want to figure out or think how to use the application rather than just use it. In order to implement the user needs, I broke down how the application is supposed to work and tried to make it as user friendly as possible, while maintaining the functionability of the game.

#### How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
Working on different aspects of the software design template really helped since I already had specifications of how the software should work it was a matter of getting the right tools, and systems in place in order to make it functionable and scalable. In the future I would definitly incoporate the software design template I found this very helpful rather than just coding and figuiring things out as I go.
